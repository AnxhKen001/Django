Poll App in Django

In this project, I created a easy and simple polling program, where you can create polls and prepare questions, edit them and also get the results.
Project structure: 
The project is 
These files can be found in the polls folder: 
The project's primary file is called manage.py and it's used to manage the project. The polls app's templates are stored in the templates folder. 
These are the locations of the html files. The polls app's static files are kept in the static subdirectory. The css and js files are located here. 
- models.py, a file containing the polls app's models. 
- admin.py file, which registers the models on the admin site. 
- views.py which contains the controllers that redirect to the views of the polls app.
- applications.py file where the polls app's setup
- tests.py. - urls.py, which includes the test
